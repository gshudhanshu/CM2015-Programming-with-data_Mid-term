# Cryptocurrency data analysis and price prediction using ARIMA model

**Introduction**

Cryptocurrencies are quickly challenging traditional currencies throughout the world. Digital currencies may be purchased in a variety of ways, making them accessible to everyone, and merchants adopting multiple cryptocurrencies could signal that money as we know it is about to undergo a huge transformation.

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency launched in the year 2009 and since then the popularity and acceptability of blockchain and cryptocurrencies has only grown upward direction. Due to its unique qualities of blockchain, such as security and transparency, cheaper cost and decentralisation, it is already being used to solve variety of real world problems as per Mallqui and Fernandes [1].

This project was inspired by Chaudhari, A. (2020, June 11). Forecasting Cryptocurrency Prices using Machine Learning [2] and Chakrabarti, S. (2021, December 3). Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using ARIMA Model [3]. The authors used data science ARIMA, LSTM and Prophet models to predict the cryptocurrency prices.

Currently, the interest of investing in crypto is growing rapidly and there is less information about crypto relative to our traditional trading and this is a new platform for me researching. I love to research new things. So, I have decided to focus on next few months price prediction of top 4 cryptocurrencies.
